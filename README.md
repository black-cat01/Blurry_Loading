# Blurry_Loading

Blurry Loading is a web development project that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic loading animation. Its main purpose is to showcase the loading progress of a website while adjusting the background blur and text opacity.

The loader features a background image that initially appears blurry and progressively becomes clearer as the loading progresses from 0 to 100. In tandem with the background transition, the opacity of the accompanying text gradually decreases from a fully visible state (opacity 1) to complete transparency (opacity 0).
